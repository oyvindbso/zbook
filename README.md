# ZBook

ZBook is an Android application designed to synchronize and manage your Zotero library on the go. It allows you to browse your collections, search for items, and download attachments for offline reading.

## Motivation

While the official Zotero for Android app is robust, it enforces the use of its embedded PDF reader. This can be less than ideal for specific use cases:

*   **E-Ink Devices**: Devices like Onyx Boox (NoteP, etc.) often have specialized system readers optimized for their E-Ink screens (refresh rates, contrast, scribbling). Using the official app's embedded reader bypasses these optimizations.
*   **Flexibility**: Users may prefer professional third-party PDF readers (like Moon+ Reader, Adobe Acrobat) that offer features not available in the official client.

**ZBook** was developed to bridge this gap. It synchronizes your library but allows you to open files using **your system's default viewer** or any installed app of your choice, providing a superior reading experience tailored to your device.

## Features

*   **Zotero Sync**: Seamlessly sync your Zotero library (collections and items) using your API Key and User ID.
*   **Browse Collections**: Navigate through your Zotero collections hierarchy.
*   **View Items**: View details of your library items, including metadata.
*   **Search**: Quickly find items by title or Pinyin (for Chinese titles).
*   **Sorting**: Sort items by Name, Author, Publish Date, Date Added, or File Size in ascending or descending order.
*   **Download Attachments**: Download PDF attachments and other files to your device for offline access.
*   **Open Files**: Open downloaded files directly with your preferred external applications.
*   **Offline Access**: Local caching (using Room database) allows you to browse your library even without an internet connection.
*   **Recent Items**: Quickly access your recently opened files.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Configure Zotero Access
To sync your library, you need to generate a private key for ZBook:
1.  Log in to [Zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org).
2.  Navigate to **Home -> Settings -> Security -> Applications**.
3.  Click **"Create new private key"**.
4.  Make sure to grant read access to your library.
5.  Note down your **User ID** (e.g., "Your userID for use in API calls is XXXXXXX").
6.  Copy the generated **API Key**.

### 2. Configure App Settings
Open ZBook and go to **Settings**:
1.  **Zotero Config**: Enter your **User ID** and **API Key** from the previous step.
2.  **WebDAV Config**:
    *   **Note**: Currently, ZBook only supports **WebDAV** for file storage and syncing.
    *   Enter your WebDAV **URL**, **Username**, and **Password**.
3.  Tap **"Test Connection"** (optional) to verify settings.
4.  Tap **"Save"**.

### 3. Sync
Return to the main screen and tap the **Sync** button (or select "Sync" from the menu) to fetch your library structure and items.
